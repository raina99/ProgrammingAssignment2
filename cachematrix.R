## Our function makeCacheMatrix  creates a matrix who can cache its inverse



##  Function cachesolve  is used to compute inverse of matrix created by the above function .If inverse has already been calculated  ( and matrix has not changed)then  cachesolve retrieves the same inverse  without computing. 
## we  assume that the matrix supplied is always invertible.
## This function creates a matrix that can cache its inverse. 
##It has many steps as we need to initialise this matrix 
## use set function to set the value of matrix 
## use get function to get the value of matrix 
## use setinverse to set the inverse of matrix ( although inverse also should be kept NULL initially )
## use getinverse to get the inverse of matrix
## use list in order to obtain the (getinverse , setinverse, get , set )  matrix values easily by using their names 
 makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  i <- NULL
  set  =  function(y  ) 
  {
    
    x <<- y 
    i <<- NULL }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(solve) i <<- solve(x)
  getinverse <- function() i
  list( setinverse = setinverse, get = get, getinverse = getinverse, set = set )
 }
 
 
 ##cachesolve function computes invese of matrix if it is NULL
 ## If its not NULL then it retrieves the value if we are asking about the same matrix 

 
 
 
  ## This  function has steps 
 ## It assigns the value of inverse to a varible 
 ## Using IF loop to inspect value of inverse and return the same if not NULL
 ## If its NULL then use solve to compute inverse 
 ## Use setinverse to set computed inverse as inverse
